## Introduction
Welcome to the **Fedora DevOps Lab** ‚Äî a hands-on, self-hosted learning environment designed to simulate modern DevOps workflows using Fedora Server as the foundation. This project serves as a personal DevOps mini-lab where I explore, implement, and document key concepts including system administration, containerization, CI/CD automation, and infrastructure monitoring.

Whether you're a fellow learner or an experienced practitioner, this repository provides a structured roadmap and practical examples for building a production-grade DevOps infrastructure from scratch.

## Vision (7-Week Projection)
The Fedora DevOps Lab is a hands-on environment designed to simulate modern DevOps workflows using Fedora Server as the base system. Over the course of 7 weeks, this project will evolve from a minimal server setup into a fully containerized, automated infrastructure showcasing continuous integration, deployment, and monitoring practices.

## Phase Breakdown
### Week 1‚Äì2: Foundation & Web Server
- Base Fedora server setup and documentation
- Secure SSH access and network configuration
- Nginx web server deployment and verification
- Git integration for infrastructure documentation and version control

### Week 3‚Äì4: Containerization
- Installation and configuration of Docker and Docker Compose
- Deployment of a sample web application container
- Setup of private container registry or GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- Documentation of container workflows

### Week 5‚Äì6: CI/CD & Monitoring
- Integration of CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Automated build and deployment for the sample app
- Setup of monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana
- Logging pipeline via Fluentd or Loki

### Week 7: Infrastructure as Code
- Ansible playbooks for complete server provisioning
- Automated deployment of entire DevOps stack
- Documentation and cleanup

## Current Status
‚úÖ Fedora Server setup complete
üöß Nginx web server deployment in progress
